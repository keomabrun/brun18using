# Reviewer 1

In this major revision of the manuscript the authors improved its quality handling some of the concerns I raised during the first round.
In particular the authors introduced a related work section in which related work is presented.

The paper, however, still lacks of a section in which the technical background is properly offered. To this end, the authors added a few details into the related work section that are not satisfactory.
In order to offer a proper overview of the technical background to the readership, I suggest the authors to add an additional section.
I understand that some of the SmartMesh IP implementation details can not be revealed as it is a proprietary solution, however, the authors could introduce some details to on TSCH in order to offer some basic background to unaware readership.
