### What do we want to obtain from the data

* PHY layer
    * rssi vs distance (Pister-hack model)              OK
    * PDR variation over time (identify patterns?)      OK
    * link asymetry                                     OK
    * pdr over RSSI (Waterfall)                         OK

* network topology
    * network churn

* power consumption
    * distribution of charge in the field

* end-to-end
    * reliability (per node?)
