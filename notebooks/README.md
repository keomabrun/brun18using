### What do we want to obtain from the data

* PHY layer
    * rssi variation over time (identify patterns?)     OK
    * rssi vs distance (Pister-hack model)              OK
    * PDR variation over time (identify patterns?)      OK
    * link asymetry                                     OK
    * rssi/pdr temp correlation                         OK
    * rssi over pdr                                     OK

* network topology
    * network churn

* network flows
    * distribution of network load in the field

* power consumption
    * distribution of charge in the field

* latency
    * distribution of latency in the field

* end-to-end
    * reliability (per node?)
